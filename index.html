Welcome to my web page my dear outsider! I am 
<b><a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=CjCcb90AAAAJ" title="Click to search Google Scholar for this entry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eduardo C. Garrido Merchán</a></b>, a researcher currently working as a Teacher Assistant @ <b><a href="http://www.uam.es/">UAM</a></b> and studying a Machine Learning PhD (mainly focused in <b>Bayesian Optimization</b>) at the <b><a href="http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~gaa/publications.html">Machine Learning group</a></b>. <br><br>

About me: My hobbies are spending time with my family, science fiction 
(mostly books), artificial intelligence and philosophy. My research 
activities include Bayesian optimization, Gaussian processes, 
probabilistic machine learning, causality and philosophy of mind. I am also informed about natural language processing and 
machine learning in general, as I am a very curious person. <br><br>

Please, if you are interested by my research or want to do a collaboration, do not hesitate to put in contact with me by 
writing an email. I will be very happy to chat with you. I am currently seeking researchers to make a full benchmark of probabilistic 
models and acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization. Also a full Bayesian treatment of models in Bayesian optimization and an 
automatic learner of acquisition functions modelled by a GP prior while the Bayesian optimization process is being launched. I also 
want to write a book of Bayesian optimization based in my PhD Thesis, if you want to collaborate, please send me an email. I want to 
integrate a causal relations extractor with a fake news classifier based on probabilistic causal graph to try and estimate the probability 
for some texts being written by some philosophers. I also want to implement the consciousness prior of Yoshua Bengio and an 
implementation of the Integrated Information theory. I also want to implement an brain-inspired AI system being a 
combination of perceptual systems (DL), symbolic systems working with the categories extracted by perceptual systems and 
finally a brain interpreter or causal network that work with the symbolic database. I would also be delighted to discuss 
some philosophy of mind ideas that I am summarizing for a philosophy of mind paper.

<h4>Bayesian Optimization</h4>
<div class="res_area">
<img src="files/constrained_multiobjective.png">
<p>This is my main area of research. 
With Bayesian Optimization we can auto-tune any machine learning 
algorithm. Furthermore, we can even perform automatic machine learning 
or optimize real industrial applications. Have you ever dream on 
pressing a red button and getting the perfect configuration for an 
algorithm or process without even thinking about how it works? Here is 
your solution. My work resides in expansions of the Bayesian 
Optimization framework. Main papers:

optimization with Gaussian processes. <b>Neurocomputing</b> 2019. </li>
		<li> Garrido-Merchán, E.C. and Hernández-Lobato, D., Predictive 
entropy search for multi-objective bayesian optimization with 
constraints. <b>Neurocomputing</b>. 2019 </li></ul>
</p>
</div>
	
<div class="res_area">	
<h4>Gaussian Processes</h4>
<img src="files/posterior_mean_persp3d.png">
<p>Bayesian Optimization uses Probabilistic
 Models in order to work. Gaussian Processes are an example. There are 
lots of stochastic processes that serve as priors over functions. These 
are like probability distributions that serve as priors over data, but 
for functions. These are very useful and beautiful to study models. My 
work resides on expanding Gaussian Processes to different scenarios.

Hernández-Lobato. "Dealing with categorical and integer-valued variables

<div class="res_area">
<h4>Causality</h4> 
<img src="files/lung_cancer_cut.png">
<p>Correlations are not the only important thing in 
machine learning. I can push a train when it starts moving and retain it
 when it stops. My movements are correlated with those of the train 
but... the train stops moving because of my actions? Although there is 
correlation there is not causation. Causation is important. I study 
different ways to represent causation using graphs. Main papers:

<h4>Machine Consciousness and Philosophy of Mind</h4>
<img src="files/consciousness.jpg">
<p>This is personal research but I consider 
to know as much about this as from my other research. Consciousness is a topic that lies in 
the borderline of the scientific method, but now even Yoshua Bengio 
studies it. It is an interdisciplinary area targeted as well by brain 
inspired AI. Philosophy of Mind has worked in this topic for quite a 
long time. Neuroscientist are also working a lot here. It is quite challenging to write about this topic but as I study lots of philosophy I think that I can also contribute to this field as an interdisciplinary computer science philosopher.
