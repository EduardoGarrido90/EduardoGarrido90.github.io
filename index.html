Welcome to my web page my dear outsider! I am <b><a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=CjCcb90AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" title="Click to search Google Scholar for this entry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eduardo C. Garrido Merchán</a></b>, a researcher currently working as a Teacher Assistant @ <b><a href="http://www.uam.es/">UAM</a></b> and studying a Machine Learning PhD (mainly focused in <b>Bayesian Optimization</b>) at the <b><a href="http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~gaa/publications.html">Machine Learning group</a></b>. <br><br>

About me: My hobbies are spending time with my family, science fiction 
(mostly books), artificial intelligence and philosophy. My research 
activities include Bayesian optimization, Gaussian processes, 
probabilistic machine learning, causality and philosophy of mind. I am also informed about natural language processing and 
machine learning in general, as I am a very curious person. <br><br>

Please, if you are interested by my research or want to do a collaboration, do not hesitate to put in contact with me by writing an email to eduardogarrido90@gmail.com. I will be very happy to chat with you. I am currently seeking researchers to make a full benchmark of probabilistic models and acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization. Also a full Bayesian treatment of models in Bayesian optimization and an automatic learner of acquisition functions modelled by a GP prior while the Bayesian optimization process is being launched. I also want to write a book of Bayesian optimization based in my PhD Thesis, if you want to collaborate, please send me an email. I want to integrate a causal relations extractor with a fake news classifier based on probabilistic causal graph to try and estimate the probability for some texts being written by some philosophers. I also want to implement the consciousness prior of Yoshua Bengio and an implementation of the Integrated Information theory. I also want to implement an brain-inspired AI system being a combination of perceptual systems (DL), symbolic systems working with the categories extracted by perceptual systems and finally a brain interpreter or causal network that work with the symbolic database. I would also be delighted to discuss some philosophy of mind ideas that I am summarizing for a philosophy of mind paper.

	<ul><b>Bayesian Optimization</b>: This is my main area of research. 
With Bayesian Optimization we can auto-tune any machine learning 
algorithm. Furthermore, we can even perform automatic machine learning 
or optimize real industrial applications. Have you ever dream on 
pressing a red button and getting the perfect configuration for an 
algorithm or process without even thinking about how it works? Here is 
your solution. My work resides in expansions of the Bayesian 
Optimization framework. Main papers:</ul>

optimization with Gaussian processes. <b>Neurocomputing</b> 2019. </li></ul>

<ul><b>Causality</b>: Correlations are not the only important thing in 
machine learning. I can push a train when it starts moving and retain it
 when it stops. My movements are correlated with those of the train 
but... the train stops moving because of my actions? Although there is 
correlation there is not causation. Causation is important. I study 
different ways to represent causation using graphs. Main papers:</ul>

	<ul><b>Gaussian Processes</b>: Bayesian Optimization uses Probabilistic
 Models in order to work. Gaussian Processes are an example. There are 
lots of stochastic processes that serve as priors over functions. These 
are like probability distributions that serve as priors over data, but 
for functions. These are very useful and beautiful to study models. My 
work resides on expanding Gaussian Processes to different scenarios.

	<ul><b>Machine Consciousness and Philosophy of Mind</b>: This is personal research but I consider 
to know as much about this as from my other research. Consciousness is a topic that lies in 
the borderline of the scientific method, but now even Yoshua Bengio 
studies it. It is an interdisciplinary area targeted as well by brain 
inspired AI. Philosophy of Mind has worked in this topic for quite a 
long time. Neuroscientist are also working a lot here. It is quite challenging to write about this topic but as I study lots of philosophy I think that I can also contribute to this field as an interdisciplinary computer science philosopher. </ul>

<!--<b>Philosophical views</b>: I will write here some of my most moderate ideas, these ideas do not represent my current point of view of philosophy and politics but are just first steps, the necessary first steps that must be done if we desire a better world for all of us...<br><br>

<li> I would like to live in a better, more advanced, free and peaceful society. Several challenges remain in order to achieve that society. <b>I think that we can not impose any idea to anyone if that person is not agree with it.</b> So the only way to make people understand new ideas is through <b>education</b>. From my point of view, education must be drastically changed.<b> Philosophy, history of religions, mathematics, economy and logic must be mandatory classes since the beggining. </b><br><br>

<li> <b>We must trust in our leaders as we trust in our doctors. Just like the Platonian Philosopher King. </b> Leaders must be prepared for their charges. <b>Passion must be erradicated from politics as Simone Weil states.</b> Democracy is the best method but it is not a perfect method as passion gets through it. Political parties must not use passion for their campaigns. <b>No left, no right, just the best from all of us, along with the best from the technology that we create.</b> <br><br>

<li> We must use technology, AI and implement an universal ethic for good. It can also help us with politics. Just for example, we can define social objectives to be optimized with AI algorithms. Macroeconomics could be optimized but as the same time we could define constraints to ensure that all collectives are taken care. <b>Politics are science, not passion and politics define problems, not opinions. </b>We must study that problems and solve them using technology and science, not based in opinions. Opinions are volatile, even the majority of people do not know what is the best for them. <b>Democracy without formalisms produce radical movements. </b><b>If we define ethics in an objective and universal way in a Kantian fashion and use AI along with experts to ensure that the politics follow that ethics, the problem could be solved. </b>We must move slowly from our democracy to a <b>Technological Aristocratic Democracy.</b><br><br>

<li> We must vote moderate ideas and programs and not people nor parties. Left and right are things of the past. Leaders who would implement the programs chosen by democracy must be elected with oppositions. They would use AI to support and to ensure that their ideas are implemented in an optimum way. We will have then a Technological Aristocratic Democracy, corruption and failures would be really rare in this case. <br><br>

<li> And of course, I am a functionalist, if not, I would not be researching in Machine Consciousness... it would be useless.-->
