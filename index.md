Thanks a lot for coming and welcome to my web page! I am 
**Eduardo C. Garrido Merch√°n**, a research scientist currently working as a Teacher Assistant @[**UAM**](http://www.uam.es/) on artificial intelligence and studying a Machine Learning PhD (mainly focused in **Bayesian Optimization**) at the [**Machine Learning group**](http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~gaa/publications.html). I am currently PhD candidate and hope to defend this summer!

About me: I enjoy a lot to spend time with my wife and kids and to read, mostly philosophy (mostly metaphysics, ethics and religion), artificial intelligence, scientific stuff and classics. I also like to debate about trascendental (and more terrenal) questions and to think about them. My research activities include Bayesian optimization, Gaussian processes, 
probabilistic machine learning, causality and machine consciousness. I am also informed about natural language processing and 
machine learning in general, as I am a very curious person.

Please, do not hesitate to send me an email if you want to discuss any topic or to get in touch. I like a lot to meet new people with common interests.
