Thanks a lot for coming and welcome to my web page! I am 
**Eduardo C. Garrido Merchán**, a research scientist currently working as a Teacher Assistant @[**UAM**](http://www.uam.es/) on artificial intelligence and studying a Machine Learning PhD (mainly focused in **Bayesian Optimization**) at the [**Machine Learning group**](http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~gaa/publications.html). I am currently PhD candidate and hope to defend this summer!

About me: I enjoy a lot to spend time with my wife and kids and to read, mostly philosophy (mostly metaphysics, ethics and religion), artificial intelligence, scientific stuff and classics. I also like to debate about trascendental (and more terrenal) questions and to think about them. My research activities include Bayesian optimization, Gaussian processes, 
probabilistic machine learning, causality and machine consciousness. I am also informed about natural language processing and 
machine learning in general, as I am a very curious person.

Please, do not hesitate to send me an email if you want to discuss any topic or to get in touch. I like a lot to meet new people with common interests. 

# Research

## Bayesian Optimization
This is my main area of research. 
With Bayesian Optimization we can auto-tune any machine learning 
algorithm. Furthermore, we can even perform automatic machine learning 
or optimize real industrial applications. Have you ever dream on 
pressing a red button and getting the perfect configuration for an 
algorithm or process without even thinking about how it works? Here is 
your solution. My work resides in expansions of the Bayesian 
Optimization framework. Main papers:
