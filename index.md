Thanks a lot for coming and welcome to my web page! I am 
**Eduardo C. Garrido Merchán**, a research scientist currently working as a Teacher Assistant @[**UAM**](http://www.uam.es/) on artificial intelligence and studying a Machine Learning PhD (mainly focused in **Bayesian Optimization**) at the [**Machine Learning group**](http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~gaa/publications.html). I am currently PhD candidate and hope to defend this summer!

About me: I enjoy a lot to spend time with my wife and kids and to read, mostly philosophy (mostly metaphysics, ethics and religion), artificial intelligence, scientific stuff and classics. I also like to debate about trascendental (and more terrenal) questions and to think about them. My research activities include Bayesian optimization, Gaussian processes, 
probabilistic machine learning, causality and machine consciousness. I am also informed about natural language processing and 
machine learning in general, as I am a very curious person.

Please, do not hesitate to send me an email if you want to discuss any topic or to get in touch. I like a lot to meet new people with common interests.

# Research

## Bayesian Optimization
<img src="files/constrained_multiobjective.png" width="50%"/>

This is my main area of research. 
With Bayesian Optimization we can auto-tune any machine learning 
algorithm. Furthermore, we can even perform automatic machine learning 
or optimize real industrial applications. Have you ever dream on 
pressing a red button and getting the perfect configuration for an 
algorithm or process without even thinking about how it works? Here is 
your solution. My work resides in expansions of the Bayesian 
Optimization framework. Main papers:
* Garrido-Merchán, E. C. and Hernández-Lobato, D. *Dealing with categorical and integer-valued variables in Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes*. **Neurocomputing**, 380:20-35, 2020. [URL](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2019.11.004)
* Garrido-Merchán, E.C. and Hernández-Lobato, D. *Predictive Entropy Search for Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Constraints*. **Neurocomputing**, 361:50-68, 2019. [URL](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2019.06.025)

## Gaussian processes
<img src="files/posterior_mean_persp3d.png" width="50%"/>

Bayesian Optimization uses Probabilistic Models in order to work. Gaussian Processes are an example. There are 
lots of stochastic processes that serve as priors over functions. These 
are like probability distributions that serve as priors over data, but 
for functions. These are very useful and beautiful to study models. My 
work resides on expanding Gaussian Processes to different scenarios.

## Causality
<img src="files/lung_cancer_cut.png" width="50%"/>

Correlations are not the only important thing in 
machine learning. I can push a train when it starts moving and retain it
 when it stops. My movements are correlated with those of the train 
but... the train stops moving because of my actions? Although there is 
correlation there is not causation. Causation is important. I study 
different ways to represent causation using graphs. Main papers:

## Machine consciousness
<img src="files/consciousness.jpg" width="50%"/>

This is personal research but I consider 
to know as much about this as from my other research. Consciousness is a topic that lies in 
the borderline of the scientific method, but now even Yoshua Bengio 
studies it. It is an interdisciplinary area targeted as well by brain 
inspired AI. Philosophy of Mind has worked in this topic for quite a 
long time. Neuroscientist are also working a lot here. It is quite challenging to write about this topic but as I study lots of philosophy I think that I can also contribute to this field as an interdisciplinary computer science philosopher.

# Personal

## Literature recommendations
Some scifi narrative that you may like:
* **Olaf Stapledon**: Star Maker, The First and Last Men, Weird John. 
* **Greg Egan**: Hard scifi. Schild ladder, Quarantine.
* **Liu Cixin**: The Three Body Problem trilogy, specially the last one: Death's End.
* **H.P. Lovecraft**: Complete narrative. Master of cosmic terror.
* **Arthur C. Clarke**: Childhood's end, 2001: A space oddysey and all the books in the saga, The city and the stars, Rendezvous with Rama. Like Olaf Stapledon, but more commercial.
* **Stephen Baxter**: Manifold Time, Manifold Space. Arthur C. Clarke of the 21th century.
* **Frank Herbert**: Destination Void, The prequels of Dune. Brilliant.
* **Isaac Asimov**: The Last Question, The Last Answer, Foundation Saga. (Specially the Second Foundation!) A classic.
* **Andy Weir**: The Egg (Only five pages, give it a try!). Spinoza's God in a tale.

## Videogames recommendations
I specially enjoy RPGs amongst the rest of videogames, these are my favourites, ordered:
* **Xenoblade Chronicles definitive edition** Nintendo Switch. Brilliant plot, philosophical references to Nietzsche.
* **Chronno Trigger** SNES. Outstanding history, covering all the ages. The main character reflects Jesus of Nazareth.
* **Lufia II** SNES. Most romantic ending ever seen in a videogame.
* **Terranigma** SNES. 
I also used to play a lot to **Age of Empires II** when I was young.

## Philosophy recommendations
I love philosophy since I was a kid. Hence, I have read quite a lot. In particular, I like philosophy of mind, science, of religion, metaphysics and ethics. Here are some recommendations:
* **History of philosophy** I recommend Reale's books for a quick tour and Copleston books for a more detailed tour. Fraile's book are quite good for the antique and medieval world. 
* **Ethics** Catholic values are great to build a better world. Even if you do not believe, reading (without prejudice for the non-believers) the Bible and in particular The New Testament can be quite an experience. Just give it a try.
* **Faith and reason** All the debates of medieval times are quite interesting. Concretely, Saint Augustine times are very interesting to read. I also recommend actual debates for example of William Lane Craig.
* **Mind** Philosophy of mind is such an amazing field. Debates of David Chalmers vs Daniel Dennett are quite interesting. The conversation is about the hard problem of consciousness.
* **Metaphysics and the ancient world** Here, I recommend to start with the presocratics, Plato and Aristotle.

I prefer to keep my views, beliefs and opinions about these topics private. But do not hesitate in debating with me any philosophical, political or religious topic, I will be delighted to do so!
